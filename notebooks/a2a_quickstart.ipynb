        "### Why Use Google A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol\n",
        "\n",
        "Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is a standardized communication framework that enables AI agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate with each other using a common JSON-RPC based protocol.  \n",
        "It provides a uniform way for agents to interact, regardless of their underlying implementation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Standardized Communication Protocol\n",
        "\n",
        "- A2A provides a consistent, JSON-RPC based protocol that any agent can implement\n",
        "- Agents can communicate without needing to know each other's internal implementation details\n",
        "- The protocol supports streaming responses for real-time interactions\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Agent Discovery and Metadata\n",
        "\n",
        "- Agents expose their capabilities through standardized metadata (AgentCard)\n",
        "- Each agent publishes its skills, input/output modes, and capabilities\n",
        "- Host agents can dynamically discover what other agents can do through the `.well-known/agent-card.json` endpoint\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Orchestration and Composition\n",
        "\n",
        "- Enables building complex multi-agent systems where a host agent can orchestrate multiple specialized agents\n",
        "- Supports sequential and parallel task execution patterns\n",
        "- Allows for sophisticated agent collaboration workflows\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Platform Independence\n",
        "\n",
        "- A2A servers can wrap agents from different frameworks (not just ADK)\n",
        "- Agents can be deployed as independent services on different infrastructure\n",
        "- Promotes loose coupling between agents\n",
